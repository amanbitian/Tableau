## A Cohort is a set of the users who share characteristics over time.
### Cohort analysis can help us track engagement or retention over time as a contrast to looking at more of the trational growth metrics that we maybe looking at already.

Cohort analysis is a kind of behavioral analytics that breaks the data in a data set into related groups before analysis. 
These groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.
Cohort analysis allows a company to "see patterns clearly across the life-cycle of a customer (or user), rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes."
By seeing these patterns of time, a company can adapt and tailor its service to those specific cohorts. 
While cohort analysis is sometimes associated with a cohort study, they are different and should not be viewed as one and the same. 
Cohort analysis is specifically the analysis of cohorts in regards to big data and business analytics, while in cohort study, data is broken down into similar groups.
